This particular project is a solution to a coding test submitted shortly before graduating in 2019

Task description:

[Redacted] have constructed the following technical test and ask all developers seeking employment to complete this test. The test is designed to let you show us what you can do, without any pressure, using whatever tools you are comfortable working with. The test is delivered via a user story, which is typical of the way our development teams consume requirements.

User story
As an investigator I would like to be able to search for a term or phrase and be delivered a list of search results so that I get a thorough list of results to review and individually analyse before I make decisions on which information to take forwards within my investigation.

Acceptance Criteria
- The user can enter a search term
- Results should be returned from two search engines and presented to the user within a single, combined list
- The functionality can be delivered via any technology and resources that you see as fit (we mainly .NET and JavaScript)
- The result must be easy for a Blackdot technical test reviewer to see it running
- Any supporting documentation you want to provide can be given via a readme file or a Word document

Notes
The acceptance criteria is deliberately open ended. Any assumptions you want to make are valid.
The idea of a technical test is to let you show us what you can do, without any pressure, using whatever tools youâ€™re comfortable working with.
